from selenium import webdriver

# You'll need to download and specify the correct path for the webdriver 
# For example, if you're using Chrome:
driver = webdriver.Chrome('/path/to/chromedriver')

# Navigate to the webpage
driver.get('https://cliniops.com')

# Get the page source (this includes the results of any JavaScript that was executed)
page_source = driver.page_source

# Save the page source to a file
with open('output.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(page_source)

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
